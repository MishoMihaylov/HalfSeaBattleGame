      <h2>Little Info About the Game</h2>
      Hey guys!

      I've made something simple here. There are some missed stuff which includes the good design but no time sorry 
      about that.

      Little explanation about the game:

      <h3>Home</h3>
      New game button appears only when the game finish.
      When you play you'll notice the 'Cheat' button. Hitting it will decrease your morale :) but since I know is tempting
      it will show you the location of the boats. It should work when is only mouse downed but also a little bug is
      left here (intentionally) if you mouse down the 'Cheat' button (and I know you'll :)) and you make the mouse up 
      outside the button, the boats will be shown until you click the button again.
      Once again I managed to make really simple design but everything needed is there.

      <h3>History</h3>
      This view contains the information of the previous played games.


      I'll be happy to hear from you!
